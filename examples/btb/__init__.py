BTB (Back to the Basics) Examples
=================================

This module contains examples demonstrating threshold-protocols
in the context of BTB—the project that inspired this framework.

BTB was a filesystem-as-circuit paradigm that approached the
point of self-organization before pausing. These examples
simulate that threshold:

- derive_threshold_demo.py: Simulates the conditions that led to the pause
- btb_config.yaml: Threshold configuration matching BTB's pause point

Usage:
    python -m examples.btb.derive_threshold_demo
    python -m examples.btb.derive_threshold_demo --files 100  # Cross threshold
