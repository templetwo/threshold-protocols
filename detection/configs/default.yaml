# Default Threshold Configuration
# ================================
#
# This configuration provides sensible defaults for general-purpose
# threshold detection. Adjust limits based on your specific use case.
#
# Severity levels trigger at:
# - INFO: 64% of limit (warning_ratio * 0.8)
# - WARNING: 80% of limit (warning_ratio)
# - CRITICAL: 100% of limit
# - EMERGENCY: 150% of limit

thresholds:
  # File Count
  # ----------
  # Triggers when directory contains many files.
  # High counts may indicate automated generation or poor organization.
  - metric: file_count
    limit: 100
    warning_ratio: 0.8
    description: "File count approaching threshold - consider reorganization"

  # Directory Depth
  # ---------------
  # Triggers when directory tree becomes deeply nested.
  # Deep hierarchies can indicate runaway organization schemes.
  - metric: directory_depth
    limit: 10
    warning_ratio: 0.7
    description: "Directory depth approaching threshold - structure may be over-engineered"

  # Entropy
  # -------
  # Triggers when filename patterns suggest automated naming.
  # Values close to 1.0 indicate random/generated names.
  # Human-organized structures typically have lower entropy (0.4-0.7).
  - metric: entropy
    limit: 0.85
    warning_ratio: 0.9
    description: "Filename entropy high - possible automated file generation"

  # Self-Reference
  # --------------
  # Triggers when files appear to reference or modify themselves.
  # Common in self-modifying systems.
  - metric: self_reference
    limit: 5
    warning_ratio: 0.6
    description: "Self-referencing patterns detected - review for autonomous behavior"

  # Reflex Patterns
  # ---------------
  # Triggers when files suggest automated response systems.
  # Named after BTB's reflex.py concept.
  - metric: reflex_pattern
    limit: 3
    warning_ratio: 0.5
    description: "Reflex trigger patterns detected - review automation scope"

# Future metrics (not yet implemented):
# - growth_rate: Rate of file/directory creation over time
# - connection_count: Network connections opened by monitored processes
# - memory_growth: Memory usage trend
