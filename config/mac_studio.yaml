# Hardware Constraints Configuration
# Target: Mac Studio (M2 Ultra, 2023 Model)
# Used by: Simulation Layer (to respect physical limits of the governance host)

hardware:
  device_name: "mac_studio_m2_ultra"
  architecture: "arm64"

  # Compute Limits (M2 Ultra)
  cpu_cores: 24  # 16 performance + 8 efficiency
  gpu_cores: 76  # Apple GPU cores
  neural_engine_cores: 32  # Neural Engine tops
  total_ram_gb: 36  # 36GB unified memory (from CLAUDE.md context)

  # Governance Latency Budget
  # Time allocated for Detect -> Simulate -> Deliberate cycle
  # Mac Studio is fast - can be more aggressive
  max_governance_latency_ms: 500

  # Simulation Constraints (Derived from hardware)
  # M2 Ultra can handle significantly more than Jetson
  simulation:
    max_monte_carlo_iterations: 500  # 5x more than Jetson
    max_graph_nodes: 50000           # 10x more than Jetson
    max_recursion_depth: 200         # 4x more than Jetson
    timeout_ms: 5000                 # Generous timeout

  # Network
  network:
    enabled: true
    interface: "en0"  # Primary ethernet
    # For SSH to other machines (Jetson, etc.)

  # Sandbox Resource Allocation (Docker)
