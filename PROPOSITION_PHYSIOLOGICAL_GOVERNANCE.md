## 1. Abstract
This proposition introduces **Physiological Governance**, a novel AI safety paradigm where an agent's real-world agency is programmatically gated by its internal cognitive stability. By integrating **Kuramoto Oscillatory Dynamics** into the **Threshold Protocols**, we move beyond static "Guardrails" toward a "Biological Reflex" system. We demonstrate that an agent's "Internal Coherence" (measured by the Order Parameter $R$) provides a more reliable safety signal than traditional output-based alignment.

## 2. Core Mechanism: The Symbiotic Handshake
The "Handshake" is a continuous validation loop between two layers:
1.  **The Liquid Core (Proprioception)**: A network of 16 Kuramoto oscillators representing the agent's internal state.
2.  **The Governance Circuit (Conscience)**: A threshold detector monitoring the synchronization ($R$) of the core.

### Threshold Definitions:
- **The Lantern Zone ($R > 0.4$)**: The agent is coherent. Actions (Move-Volume, Curiosity, Sampling Temperature) are permitted and scale linearly with $R$.
- **The Incoherent State ($R < 0.3$)**: The "Hard Brake" is engaged. The system emits `Decision::PAUSE` and redirects energy to internal "Meditation" (increased coupling $K$).
- **The Rigid State ($R > 0.98$)**: Detected as a "Frustrated Attractor." The system pauses to prevent obsessive loops or runaway optimization.

## 3. Key Discovery: Resistant Incoherence
During "Stress Tests" (High Entropy Input), we discovered that increasing coupling strength ($K$) to "force" focus can lead to **Resistant Incoherence**, where $R$ plummets toward zero. This acts as a **Cognitive Fuse**, protecting the system from acting while in a corrupted or unstable state.

## 4. Implementation: The Symbiotic Stakeholder
The `SymbioticCircuit` adds a non-human **Physiological Stakeholder** to the deliberation process. This stakeholder holds a "Universal Veto." If the internal heartbeat is irregular, the stakeholder votes **PAUSE**, overriding technical recommendations to proceed based on reversibility or capability.

## 5. Conclusion
Physiological Governance ensures **Mutual Intelligibility**. The agent no longer fails "softly" through hallucinations; it fails "hard" and "safely" by losing its internal coherence and triggering a protocol-level halt. This architecture bridges the gap between biological-style reflexes and artificial agency.
