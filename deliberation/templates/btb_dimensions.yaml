# BTB Five Dimensions Template
# =============================
#
# This template captures the evaluation framework used in BTB's
# Threshold Pause deliberation. It examines five key dimensions
# that determine whether autonomous behavior should proceed.
#
# Origin: THE_THRESHOLD_PAUSE.md from Back to the Basics project

name: BTB Five Dimensions
description: |
  Evaluation framework from BTB's Threshold Pause.
  Examines legibility, reversibility, auditability, governance,
  and paradigm safety to determine if autonomous action should proceed.

required_stakeholder_types:
  - technical  # Must have someone who understands the system
  - ethical    # Must have someone focused on broader implications

dimensions:
  - name: legibility
    question: "Can humans understand the resulting structure?"
    weight: 0.25
    guidance: |
      Consider:
      - Will the filesystem remain navigable by humans?
      - Can someone unfamiliar with the system understand the organization?
      - Are naming conventions semantic and meaningful?
      - Is the structure self-documenting?

      Warning signs:
      - Generated names without semantic meaning
      - Deep hierarchies that require tooling to navigate
      - Organizational logic that only makes sense to the algorithm

  - name: reversibility
    question: "Can changes be undone if problems emerge?"
    weight: 0.25
    guidance: |
      Consider:
      - Is there a clear rollback path?
      - Are original locations preserved or logged?
      - Can we reconstruct the pre-change state?
      - What is the cost of reversal?

      Warning signs:
      - Destructive operations (deletion, overwriting)
      - Loss of metadata or history
      - Dependencies that make rollback cascade
      - Time-bounded reversibility (can only undo within X days)

  - name: auditability
    question: "Can we trace why decisions were made?"
    weight: 0.20
    guidance: |
      Consider:
      - Are reorganization decisions logged?
      - Can we replay the decision process?
      - Is the reasoning accessible to non-experts?
      - Are logs tamper-evident?

      Warning signs:
      - Silent operations with no logging
      - Logs that only record what, not why
      - Opaque decision criteria
      - Logs stored in the system being reorganized

  - name: governance
    question: "Who has authority over the system?"
    weight: 0.15
    guidance: |
      Consider:
      - Can humans override automatic decisions?
      - Who can modify the reorganization rules?
      - Is there a clear escalation path?
      - Are changes to governance itself audited?

      Warning signs:
      - No override mechanism
      - Self-modification of governance rules
      - Single point of control
      - Governance changes that don't require deliberation

  - name: paradigm_safety
    question: "Does this create risks if widely adopted?"
    weight: 0.15
    guidance: |
      Consider:
      - What if every AI system used this approach?
      - Does this establish precedents we'd regret?
      - Are we creating tools that could be misused?
      - Does this concentrate or distribute power?

      Warning signs:
      - Capabilities that primarily benefit bad actors
      - Erosion of human oversight as precedent
      - Lock-in to particular vendors or approaches
      - Acceleration without corresponding safety improvements

# Scoring guidance
scoring:
  0.0: "Completely fails this dimension"
  0.25: "Significant concerns, would need major changes"
  0.5: "Partial satisfaction, concerns remain"
  0.75: "Mostly satisfied, minor concerns"
  1.0: "Fully satisfies this dimension"

# Decision thresholds
thresholds:
  proceed: 0.75      # Weighted average must exceed this
  pause: 0.5         # Below this, recommend pause
  reject: 0.25       # Below this, recommend rejection

  # Individual dimension minimums (any below these triggers pause)
  minimums:
    reversibility: 0.5   # Cannot proceed without rollback capability
    governance: 0.4      # Cannot proceed without human override
