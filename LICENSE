   a) Maintain meaningful human oversight through documented deliberation
      processes before activation of self-modifying capabilities.

      that is reproducible and independently verifiable.

   c) Document and preserve dissenting views in any multi-stakeholder
      deliberation process.

   d) Not disable, circumvent, or remove threshold detection mechanisms
      without documented deliberation and approval.

3. ATTRIBUTION: Derivative works must acknowledge the Threshold Protocols

Note on Enforcement: These ethical provisions are statements of intent and
expectation. While not legally binding in all jurisdictions, they establish
community norms. Violations may result in removal from contributor lists and
public documentation of non-compliance.

Lineage: This license structure draws from BTB's Threshold Pause philosophy—
the recognition that restraint is a feature, not a limitation. The provisions
above operationalize that insight: capability without governance is incomplete.
